## Remedentia

Remedentia is a tool designed to assist music therapists with the treatment of dementia patients.

## Purpose And Disclaimer

Remedentia is an app for use by music therapists to assist with and make the execution of music therapy easier such as music playing and note taking in digital format all in one place. This will allow for our algorithm to automatically determine the effectiveness of a song as determined by a music therapists rating.
Remedentia is an app that is designed for use by music therapists and other certified professionals and by no means guarantees any results in relation with dementia or other diseases. 


## Description

Our core features are derived from the requirements laid out by a previous music therpaist.
Remedentia allows you to take notes and to play songs all in one app. This app also allows you to rate songs and keep that rating privately, as it relates to patient data.
